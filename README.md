# Metro Visualization and ONS Fraud Data Analytics
This repository contains two independent projects:

Istanbul Metro Visualization (Python): A project to model and visualize Istanbul's metro network using the NetworkX library.
ONS Fraud and Computer Misuse Analysis (R): A project for data transformation, basic statistics, analytics, and visualization using datasets from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

## Istanbul Metro Visualization (Python)
### Features
Graph Representation: Model Istanbul's metro stations and connections as a graph.
Geographical Layout: Visualize metro lines using NetworkX layouts.
Distance Calculation: Calculate distances between stations in the network.
Transfer Simulation: Identify and model transfer points between lines.


## Requirements
