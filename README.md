# Istanbul Metro Lines Visualization
This project visualizes Istanbul's metro network using Python and the NetworkX library. It models the metro lines as a graph, where stations are represented as nodes and connections between them as edges. Additionally, the project includes features such as calculating distances between stations and generating a geographical layout for the network.

## Features
Graph Representation: Model metro stations and connections as a NetworkX graph.
Geographical Layout: Plot the metro network using station coordinates.
Distance Calculation: Compute distances between stations.
Transfer Simulation: Identify transfer points between metro lines.

## Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher
NetworkX
Matplotlib
