# Istanbul Metro Lines Visualization
This project visualizes Istanbul's metro network using Python and the NetworkX library. It models the metro lines as a graph, where stations are represented as nodes and connections between them as edges. Additionally, the project includes features such as calculating distances between stations and generating a geographical layout for the network.
